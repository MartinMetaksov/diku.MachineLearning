The implementation is done in Python3.5.
The main fail is main.py and it is done in the form of a unit testing file, containing test cases for each question.
To run main.py, the command "python3.5 main.py" can be ran from any command line/terminal.
There various other ways to run it as well, e.g. through a python IDE.
Additionally, several python packages need to be installed, listed below.
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib

Note: The tests run independently in a random order, thus printed data may (and probably will) appear out of order.
